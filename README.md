# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-kamara">Joseph Kamara</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I specialize in AI, technology risk, and cybersecurity. My work focuses on solving complex problems through practical implementation. My projects span technology risk assessment, AI governance, vulnerability management, and threat detection. Each repository demonstrates real-world applications in security operations.

You'll find working solutions with detailed documentation here. Current focus areas include vulnerability management workflows, threat detection systems, and incident response automation.
Feel free to explore the repositories. Each project includes examples and setup instructions for implementation in your environment.
